# ChatWithCode Demonstration

## Fetching Repository File Structure

```python
# Using ChatWithCode to fetch the file structure of a GitHub repository
repositoryUrl = "https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName"
file_structure = chatwithcode.FetchRepoFileStructure(repositoryUrl=repositoryUrl)
print(file_structure)

# Using ChatWithCode to retrieve the contents of specific files in a GitHub repository
filePaths = ["path/to/your/file1", "path/to/your/file2"]
file_contents = chatwithcode.FetchFileContentsFromRepo(repositoryUrl=repositoryUrl, filePaths=filePaths)
print(file_contents)

# Using ChatWithCode to extract functions from specific files in a GitHub repository
functions = chatwithcode.ExtractFunctionsFromRepoFiles(repositoryUrl=repositoryUrl, filePaths=filePaths)
print(functions)


You can deposit the above markdown code to your repo. Remember to replace `YourUsername` and `YourRepoName` with your actual GitHub username and repository name, respectively. Also, update the `filePaths` with the actual paths to the files you want to analyze.

**Questions to Clarify the Task:**
- Would you like any additional modifications or details added to the markdown demonstration?
- Are there any other aspects of the plugins you'd like to explore further?

Let's continue our structured dialogue to ensure all your needs are addressed.
